# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM-
In this project, I’ve combined the power of data analysis and deep learning to predict Bitcoin prices. Using historical price data, I explored trends, calculated moving averages, and built an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast future price movements. 
What’s Inside?

Data Exploration: Cleaned and analyzed Bitcoin's historical prices (BTC-USD) using the yfinance library.
Trend Analysis: Used moving averages to identify short-term and long-term trends.
LSTM Model: Implemented an LSTM neural network to capture patterns in the data and predict future prices.
Visualizations: Plotted actual vs. predicted prices and trend analyses to make findings easy to understand.
A Note on Bitcoin Prices:
Bitcoin prices are inherently unpredictable. Numerous factors influence its closing price, such as global economic conditions, market sentiment, and geopolitical events. This project focuses solely on analyzing past Bitcoin data to understand trends and build a predictive model based on historical patterns.
